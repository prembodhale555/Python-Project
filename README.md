# Python-Project
The Autonomous Vehicle Decision Simulator uses Python and Boolean logic to model real-time traffic scenarios. It enables vehicles to make safe, ethical decisions—like lane changes and obstacle avoidance—through modular, rule-based simulations that reflect intelligent, AI-driven mobility systems.
